# music_controller
music_controller is a fullstack web app that I'm building using django and React. <br>
This app lets you create a room for a group of people to control the music on spotify that's being played.<br>
It's based on a [course on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j). The course itself is a very much deprecated so it is really nice challange to try to reproduce the outcome using the same yet different tools esspecialy in newer React and Material UI components.
